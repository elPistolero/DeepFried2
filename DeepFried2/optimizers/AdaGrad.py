    Implements Duchi's "Adaptive Subgradient" method, aka AdaGrad.
    Chris Dyer's "Notes on AdaGrad" are pretty awesome for practical purposes.

    TL;DR: AdaGrad doesn't need additional parameters (a lie) and makes the
           optimization much less sensitive to the learning-rate!

    In reality, it was a pioneer of fixing slow-learning features by adapting
    a feature's own learning-rate using an estimate of its raw 2nd moment, but
    its ideas have flown into superior AdaDelta and Adam.

    The updates are:

        g²_{e+1} = g²_e + ∇(p_e)²
        p_{e+1} = p_e - (lr / √g²_{e+1}) * ∇p_e

    that is, divide the learning-rate by a running square of the gradient.

    Note that this would lead to division by 0 in the beginning for those
    weights which don't receive a gradient (might be many with ReLUs), so we
    initialize g² with a small value.
